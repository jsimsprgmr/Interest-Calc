# Interest-Calc
This is an interest calculation for a bank.
I had to make a monthly and yearly interst calculator so someonec could put in their investment amount and how long it would be invested, and then the calculator would calculate the intreset amounts with and without repeat investment.
I think that I did this entire project well. I liked the loop for the interest calcuations. I enjoyed figuring it out. 
This is a farily simple program so I am not quite sure where I coudl improve it. I did not have many challenges with it. Some people could have had issues with the math or something, but as I am a trained accountant, I found it all very easy. I enjoyed the way it made the think about something I do often but from a different persepctive. 
I think the most imporatnt skill I learned in this project was the looping as well as the specialized outputting. Those will transfer well. I kept it readable and maintained by having good commenting and documentation throughout!
